My First Machine Learning Project: Predicting Heart Disease! ❤️
Excited to share my journey into machine learning with my first project—heart disease prediction! 🏥 Using scikit-learn, I trained a Random Forest Classifier to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of heart disease.
🔍 What I did:
 ✅ Loaded and explored the heart disease dataset 📊
 ✅ Split the data into training & test sets
 ✅ Trained a Random Forest model 🌲
 ✅ Made predictions & evaluated performance
💡 What I learned:
 🔹 The importance of data preprocessing and splitting data correctly
 🔹 How to train and test a classification model
 🔹 How to measure model performance using .score()


 self taught flutter and java native developer

 took an machine learning course with lara wehbe , and now diving into a deep learning course
